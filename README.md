## Compile from scss to css
When you install Sass on the command line, youâ€™ll be able to run the sass executable to compile .sass and .scss files to .css files. For example:
```
sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css
```
For my example use this command:
```
sass scss/style.scss css/style.css
```
